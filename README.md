# Really, that's it.

A couple friends and I started making this project as a final project in our final year of high school. We never ended up finishing it. I would not recommend using it as a good reference codebase, this was when I was starting to learn rust. This will likely remain unfinished for all eternity, but I'm leaving it around for posterity's sake.

Take a look around if you want.
